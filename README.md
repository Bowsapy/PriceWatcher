Tkinter-based desktop application for price monitoring on the Czech e-commerce comparison website Heureka.
The user selects a product by providing a link to its lowest price page on Heureka (e.g. https://damske-bundy.heureka.cz/.../#prehled/?sort-filter=lowest_price) and sets a target price they are willing to pay.

The application regularly checks the current lowest price. If the price is equal to or lower than the user’s target price, the user receives an email notification.
In addition, the app displays historical price data, including the average, latest, minimum, and maximum price, and visualizes price development in a graph.
